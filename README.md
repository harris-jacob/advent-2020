## Advent of Code
My attempt at 2020's advent of code. I am terrible at all things algorithms and data structures, so this should a great opportunity to learn. Also, I suck at c++ too, so hopefully I can pick up some of that too.

## Technologies
- [c++](https://www.cplusplus.com/)
- [CMAKE](https://cmake.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [VScode + Devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)
- Christmas spirit ðŸŽ… 

## Building the environment
- Make sure you have docker, vscode and the devcontainer extension installed.
- `git clone` this repo.
- open the directory in vscode and follow the prompt that asks you to build and open in container.

## Bulding and running the code
- run a `cmake configure` from vscode or the terminal.
- hit an `f7`.
- run `test` target to run all example solutions tests.
- run `main` to launch all solutions with their respective inputs.
